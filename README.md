# Androgen Receptor Variant Effect Prediction

We fine-tuned ESM-2 models using the ESM-Effect method to predict the effects of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) on the human androgen receptor. This repository provides the following resources:

* Train script
* Preprocessed data and dataset folds used in the paper
